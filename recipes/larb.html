        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pork Larb can be made into a quick and simple recipe, if you're on a time crunch.
            It's essentially a short fry of pork, then dressed in a seasoned sauce.
            Larb can be placed over rice, in a lettuce cup, or any other choice of carbohydrate. (<em>Though I would suggest sticking to rice, as it absorbs any extra seasoning really well.</em>)
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Larb utilizes fish sauce, which for many, might be a deal breaker.
            Fish sauce, though pungent, provides a nice vinegar and umami blend, that really enhances the flavor of the meat.
            Larb, focuses on the meat, but adds texture and color with the additional garnishes.
